<h1 align="center">ğŸ”¦ Re-activating the Eras Tour Bracelet</h1>

During the finale of the **Eras Tour concert**, an infrared (IR) signal is emitted to trigger the wristbands, causing them to flash continuously until the battery runs out.

This project shows how to **re-activate your bracelet** using a **DIY infrared emitter** that sends the appropriate PixMob signal â€” bringing the lights back to life âœ¨.

## ğŸ’» Source Code

This project is forked from the open-source work from the **PixMob reverse engineering** community. The original signals were captured using **Flipper Zero**, and decoded by a team of talented contributors.

> ğŸ§  Full credit goes to the developers who reverse-engineered the protocol and made it publicly available.
